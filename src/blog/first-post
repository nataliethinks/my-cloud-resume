My First Blog Post
Building My Resume Website with Cloud (On a $0 Budget)
This is my first blog post.
Today I worked on turning my resume into an actual website instead of just a PDF or a static page.
The goal was simple: make something real, deploy it, and learn how cloud tools actually work.
By the end of the day, I was honestly surprised by how much I built.
What I did today
I created a resume website using React and deployed it on GitHub Pages.
Instead of stopping there, I wanted the site to feel more “alive”, so I added a real backend.
Now my resume site has:
A Resume page
A Blog page (this one)
A real visitor counter powered by a cloud API
Everything is live and deployed.
The tech I used (nothing fancy)
I didn’t use anything paid or complicated.
Frontend
React
GitHub Pages
GitHub Actions (for deployment)
Backend
Cloudflare Workers (serverless API)
Cloudflare D1 (database)
All of this runs on free tiers.
The visitor counter
Instead of a fake number, I built a real visitor counter.
Every time someone opens the page:
The frontend calls an API
The API updates a counter in a database
The latest number is returned and shown on the page
It sounds small, but it helped me understand how frontend, backend, and cloud services connect together.
What I struggled with (and learned)
Things didn’t work perfectly the first time.
I ran into:
CI build failures because of small ESLint issues
GitHub Pages caching old versions
API returning “Not Found” because of wrong paths
The counter staying at 0 because the database wasn’t connected properly
Local working, but production not working
Fixing these taught me more than following a tutorial ever could.
Why I’m writing this blog
I want to document what I build and what I learn, even if it’s messy or imperfect.
This blog is not meant to be “polished tutorials”.
It’s more like a learning log — what I tried, what broke, and how I fixed it.
What’s next
Next, I want to:
Turn blog posts into their own pages (/blog/some-title)
Write more about the visitor counter and cloud setup
Improve the design and layout
Keep learning more about cloud and DevOps in a practical way
